# **My Weather Station V1**
A project in which I wanted to create working device from scrap - weather station.

## **Introduction**
Why project like this?
Because recently (in the past few months) I joined Science Club [**SBT - Solar Boat Team**](http://solarboat.pwr.edu.pl/)
at **Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology**, where due to influence of passion of more experienced, older students, I started to study STM32 architecture. Though, I have never been doing hardware stuff like this, the idea of designing a working device which can be useful - quickly found my interests. 

### **Project Guidelines**
Below listing shows main goals which project aimed to achieve:
- Have fun
- Design a working device
- Study STM32 architecture
- Study techniques of programming an external embedded system
- Study analog signal processing in **C** Programming Language
- Gather ideas for future projects
- **What would you do next with this knowledge?**

### **Final Device Requirements**
Device should:
-[x] Have total budget no more than 10$
- Consume input voltage: 3.3V/5V
- Update current ambient temperature (Celsius scale)
- Update current air humidity (Percent scale)
- Print necessary data on the screen
- Light a LED bulb on data update
- Have RESET button
