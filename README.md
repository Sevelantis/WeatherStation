# **My Weather Station V1**
A project in which I wanted to create working device from scrap - weather station.

## **Introduction**
Why project like this?
Because recently (in the past few months) I joined Science Club **SBT - Solar Boat Team**
at **Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology**, where due to influence of passion of more experienced, older students, I started to study STM32 architecture. Though, I have never been doing hardware stuff like this, the idea of designing a working device which can be useful - quickly found my interests.
